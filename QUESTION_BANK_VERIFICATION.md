2. **From PDF Tab** - Upload PDFs and generate questions
3. **Custom Content Tab** - Create questions with custom parameters

#### Features:
- âœ… **Question Set Management** - View, select, and delete sets
- âœ… **Study Mode** - Sequential question display with answer tracking
- âœ… **Similar Question Generation** - **FIXED:** Modal opens with `setShowSimilarModal(true)` (Line 646)
- âœ… **Answer Types Support**
  - Multiple Choice with options
  - True/False questions
  - Short answer text input
  - Fill in the blank
- âœ… **Results Display** - Score calculation and performance review
- âœ… **PDF Upload** - File handling with progress feedback

#### Design - Dashboard Consistent:
- âœ… Sharp corners (4px border-radius)
- âœ… Minimalist aesthetic
- âœ… Dark theme with accent colors (#D7B38C on #16181d)
- âœ… Responsive layout (max-width: 1400px)
- âœ… Smooth animations and transitions

## ðŸ”§ Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Path Resolution in PerformanceAnalyzer
**Issue:** `FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'backend\\\\models'`

**Root Cause:** Relative path used in service initialization
- Old: `self.model_path = "backend/models"`
- New: `self.model_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "models")`

**Result:** âœ… Path resolves correctly from any execution directory
- Verified path: `D:\Brainwave\L1\backend\models`

### Fix 2: Similar Question Modal Not Opening
**Issue:** "Generate Similar" button didn't open modal dialog

**Root Cause:** Missing state setter in onClick handler
- Old: `onClick={() => setSelectedQuestionForSimilar(...)}`
- New: Added `setShowSimilarModal(true)` to trigger modal

**Result:** âœ… Modal now opens properly when button clicked
